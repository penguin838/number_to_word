# number_to_word
A simple script that converts a number to word form

## Usage
Import the script
```python
import number_to_word
```
Example:
```python
print(number_to_word.convert(123))

#Output: one hundred and twenty-three
```
## Limitations
The script contains a list labeled "suffix". If the number inputed is higher than the highest suffix, it will return an error.
Adding more suffixes increase the range of the program.

## Notes
-This is my first program published to Github, so any constructive critisism or tips would be helpful :)

-I probably will update/improve this program in the future
